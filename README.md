# Login Auth Site with OTP

This is a project that contains a login auth page featuring functional OTP codes

## Requirements

- Python v3.10 onwards
- PostgresQL

## Description

The frontend has been created using basic form template from HTML and CSS (internal). No javascript has been using in the application.
The user keys in details contained in the database to grant them access to the landing page of the application. When the user enters the wrong details, they are provided with a one-time password they can use as a log-in alternative for the forgotten/wrong password.

All passwords are stored within a Postgres Database and the backend operations are done with Flask. The OTP codes are generated randomly using a randomizer (created using the Python 'random' module) and the sample generated is displayed on the login page when the password and/or username are wrong.

Passwords provided by the users during registration are hashed (encoded in utf-8) and stored in the database. The use of 'salt' has also been incorporated for that extra, spicy layer of securityðŸ˜†. During log-in, the hashes are verified before the user is allowed to proceed to the landing page.

### Important note

Remember to set user variables in the terminal for ease of identification of variables declared during execution (saving time too so you don't refer to a book of usernames and their respective passwordsðŸ˜‰):

```shell
export DB_NAME = 'database_name'
export DB_PASSWORD = 'password'
export DB_USERNAME = 'database_username'
```
